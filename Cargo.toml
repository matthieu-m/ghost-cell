[features]

#   Enables `alloc` (hence `StaticRc`) by default.
default = ["alloc"]

#   Checks `split`/`join` at compile-time rather than run-time.
#   This currently requires nightly, see src/lib.rs for the features required.

#   Enables `alloc`, and therefore `StaticRc`.
alloc = []

#   Enables `lift`, an experimental feature to allow tying the knot.

#   This currently requires nightly, and specifically the `async_stream` feature.

#   Enables `CoerceUnsized` on `StaticRc`.
#   This currently requires nightly, and specifically the `coerce_unsized` feature.
